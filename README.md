Description:
    This is a personal learning project where I explore WebGL (Web Graphics Library) to understand 3D rendering, shaders, and interactive graphics in the browser. The goal is to experiment with core WebGL concepts, such as:
    Rendering 3D objects (using vertices, indices, and buffers)
    GLSL shaders (vertex & fragment shaders for custom effects)
    Transformations & animations (matrices, rotations, scaling)
    Lighting & textures (Phong shading, image textures)
    User interaction (mouse/keyboard controls for 3D scenes)
    This project serves as a hands-on way to learn computer graphics fundamentals while building small demos and visual experiments.

Possible Extensions (Future Work):
    Three.js integration (for higher-level 3D rendering)
    Physics simulations (e.g., collision detection)
    WebGPU comparison (performance vs. WebGL)

Tech Stack:
    WebGL 1.0/2.0 (raw API)
    JavaScript/TypeScript
    GLSL (for shaders)
    HTML5 Canvas
    Would love feedback from fellow graphics enthusiasts! 

Usage Example (for GitHub README):
